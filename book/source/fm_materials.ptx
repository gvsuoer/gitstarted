          Open the <c>.exe</c> file and follow the instructions to install Git Bash. Most of the default 
          options should not be changed. However, please read the following notes before installing.

          When you reach the <q>Select Components</q> screen, I recommend leaving the default boxes 
          checked as they will be useful later on. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When you reach the <q>Choosing the default editor used by Git</q> screen, I recommend selecting
          the <q>Use Visual Studio Code...</q> option.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you reach the <q>Adjusting the name of the initial branch...</q> screen, I recommend selecting 
          <q>Override the default branch name...</q> and type in <c>main</c> (lowercase) into the box. 
          This will help us match the Mac version and respect
