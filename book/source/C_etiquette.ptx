  <title>Basic Computer Etiquette</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      For those who do not have a lot of experience with computers, start here for an introduction 
      into certain computer basics. This book assumes that you are familiar with the content in this 
      chapter. Don't worry, I don't assume you know anything about the <q>command line</q> (this 
      will be introduced in <xref ref="S_whatiscommline"/>) or Git (<xref provisional="C_git"/>). 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, for the content of this book to make sense, a few basics must be covered, such as proper 
      file naming and a knowledge of common file extensions. Taking the time to read this chapter 
      <em>will</em> pay off in the long run and will make using the command line and Git simpler 
      (and we love simplicity, espeically with computers!).
