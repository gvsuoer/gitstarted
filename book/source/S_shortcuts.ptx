  <title>Keyboard Shortcuts</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      You may be able to use your computer fine without any shortcuts. But wow, do they make your life 
      easier. This section could go in an appendix but I think it is so important to know at many shortcuts 
      as possible to help you use your computer faster. I use shortcuts every day in my web browser, 
      programming software, documents editing software (e.g., Microsoft Word), and just my computer in 
      general. I have tried to break up the following shortcuts by where you might use them; however, 
      many are fairly universal and could work in other places.

      Note: as described in <xref provisional="fm_differences"/>, Windows uses <kbd>Control</kbd> 
      (or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>) as the <q>main</q> button whereas Mac uses <kbd>Command</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>).
