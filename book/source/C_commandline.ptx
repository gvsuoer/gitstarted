  <title>The Command Line</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      So you came here to learn about Git? 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stop right there! 
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to learn Git, let's begin with 
      something a little less complex: the command line. Yep, the <q>hacker screen</q>, the plain-looking 
      interface you often see in spy movies. While we won't be doing any hacking, we will need to have 
      and understanding of the command line, its purpose, and some of its useful functions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beware to all beginners who skip this chapter! The most popular way to use Git is through the 
      command line; without at least a basic understanding of it, you will have a hard time with the 
      later subjects.
