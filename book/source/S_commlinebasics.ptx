  <introduction>
    <p>
      The first step to tackling the command line is to not be scared. Sure, it looks daunting and if you 
      make a mistake you might some lengthy error messages, but at the very least, the command line 
      <em>is just another way to interact with your computer</em>.

      A great question! The <term>command line</term> (also known as a <term>command prompt</term>,  
      <term>command-line interface</term>, or <term>terminal</term>) is an application that accepts 
      lines of text and sends that text to your computer which performs an action. 

      You may also hear about shells. A <term>shell</term> helps make the command line more interactive 
      and user friendly. Shells add colors, some informative information, and predictive text. We will 
      return to shells and command line customization in <xref provisional="commline customize"/>.

      Terminals are powerful and fast. Think of them as a more direct way to interact with your computer.
      You can delete files with the terminal. You can create new files. You can move files. You can open 
      files. And more. There are many, many complicated and hard-to-comprehend functions of the command 
      line. Rest assured, this chapter sticks with the basics; we will learn necessary functions for 
      using Git (and a few others).

    <title>Where Is <em>My</em> Command Line?</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        If you have a computer, you have a terminal. You may not have ever used it or known it was there,
        but it's hiding, waiting for use. Let's find it.

          Luckily, the terminal is easy to find on a Mac: it's called <c>terminal.app</c> and can be 
          found in numerous ways.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                (Recommended) Press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> to open Spotlight Search.
                Start typing <q>terminal</q> and the app should pop up quickly. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> 
                or click on the result.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Navigate to the Applications folder in the Finder. Then, open the Utilities folder and 
                double click on <c>terminal.app</c>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Find it through the Launchpad. What's the Launchpad, you ask? On most Mac keyboards, it 
                is on the key corresponding to <kbd>F4</kbd> and looks like a bunch of boxes arranged in 
                rows. You can also access the Launchpad by clicking the Launchpad icon in the Dock (also 
                boxes arranged in rows) or by going into the Applications folder in the Finder and double 
                clicking on the <c>Launchpad.app</c> icon. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Once in the Launchpad, find the Terminal. You can either search for it in the search bar 
                at the tope of the screen or scroll through your apps until you find it. (Note: it might 
                be in the Other folder).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          Once you open the terminal, you should be presented with a blank screen, such as the one shown 
          in <xref ref="mac-term-start"/>

          <figure xml:id="mac-term-start">
            <caption>Opening Screen for Mac Terminal</caption>
            <image source="mac-term-start.png">
              <description></description>
              
            </image>
          </figure>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that at the top of my terminal, it says <q>iancurtis<mdash/> -zsh</q>. This indicates that
          I am using the <c>zsh</c> shell. This is the default for MacOS Catalina and later. If yours 
          states something else (such as <c>bash</c> or <c>fish</c>) and you would like to use <c>zsh</c>
          to follow along, paste <c>chsh -s /bin/zsh</c> into the command line, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, 
          enter your password to your computer, and restart the terminal.
