  <introduction>
    <p>
      So what is GitHub? Well, it is a website at its basics. It is a website that allows us to share our 
      files with the world and it widely used by the coding/programming community. With GitHub, any public 
      code can be viewed by anyone. Each person is able to copy the code and mess with it on their own computer, 
      all without the original being changed. But if someone wants to change the original, they can submit 
      a request asking the owners to incorporate their changes. GitHub keeps track of all of this information 
      and can also help with version control. If you make a big mistake, you can revert back to old versions 
      and try again. GitHub works closely with Git (hence its name) and is a nice interface for 
      many common Git functions.

      Before attempting to tackle Git, I think it's best to show you the ropes of GitHub. After we get set 
      up here and get more comfortable with the GitHub jargon, we can move to Git. 
      In this section we will create a GitHub account and get familiar with the layout of GitHub. Much of 
      what is said in this section and chapter is directly applicable to Git (<xref provisional="C_git"/>).

    <title>Creating A GitHub Account</title>

    <p>
      Creating a GitHub account is easy and free. Just be careful along the way; there are a few things 
      to take into consideration. If you already have a GitHub account, skip to <xref ref="hub-profile"/>.
      If you don't, keep reading.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, navigate to <url href="https://github.com"></url>. Any browser should work. Click on the 
      <q>Sign Up</q> in the top right corner. A welome box should pop up. Follow the instructions to create
      an account:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Enter your email
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Create a password
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Choose a username. Attention! Choose your username carefully. 
            <url href="https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice">Jennifer Bryan</url> 
            has some great tips for choosing a username. A few are reproduced here:
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re dealing with. Also 
                  makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack. But, of course, 
                  someone with no GitHub activity will probably be squatting on that.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future [or current] boss.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Shorter is better than longer.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. 
                  In some settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or place of 
                  residence, e.g. JennyFromTheBlock.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Avoid the use of upper vs. lower case to separate words. We highly recommend all 
                  lowercase. GitHub treats usernames in a case insensitive way, but using all 
                  lowercase is kinder to people doing downstream regular expression work with 
                  usernames, in various languages. A better strategy for word separation is to use a 
                  hyphen - or underscore _. [Again the ideas from <xref ref="filenamespaces"/> come back.]
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            While it is possible to change your username later, it is better to not fall back on that as 
            that can cause complications. As an example, my username is <q>ian-curtis</q>. I would have 
            preferred to have it without any spaces but that was taken :(. It is short, simple, timeless, 
            and I do not feel bad sharing it with anyone. If you have a very common name, consider using 
            hyphens and underscores or rearranging your name. I could have tried <q>curtisi</q> or 
            <q>curtian</q> (which sounds like I'm an alien). 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you finish setting up the account (email verification may be required), navigate back to the 
      home page (<url href="https://github.com"></url>) and carry on.

    <title>The Profile Page</title>
    <idx><h>github</h><h>profile</h></idx>
    <idx><h>repo</h></idx>
    <idx><h>repository</h></idx>
    <idx><h>github</h><h>repo</h></idx>
    <idx><h>github</h><h>repository</h></idx>

    <p>
      You should be on the home page of GitHub. You may not see much if you just created an accout. 
      Probably lots of buttons telling you to get started or take a tutorial and whatnot. Feel free to 
      click on those if you'd like, but I'd suggest following along here first. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Your profile page can be found by clicking on the robot-y icon in the top right and clicking on 
      <q>Your profile</q>. (Notice that the URL uses your username.) You probably don't see much. That's ok, 
      you haven't created anything yet! On this page (the <q>Overview</q> tab) you can see your popular 
      repositories, a graph of your contributions and a summary of your activity. Check out 
      <url href="https://github.com/ian-curtis">my profile page</url> for an example.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, you can edit your basic profile information on the left hand side including your profile image, 
      name, bio, and location. I would recommend filling as much of that out as possible; it allows companies 
      and other people to find you and confirm that you are who you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wait a minute, I just used an unfamiliar word: repository. Essentially, a <term>repository</term> 
      is the Git/GitHub to say <q>directory</q> or <q>folder</q>. A repository is usually one project; 
      one repository contains all of the files and information for one project. For example, the files 
      for this book can all be found under my repository titled 
      <url href="https://github.com/ian-curtis/gitstarted">gitstarted</url>. This book constitutes as 
      one project and therefore all files for this book are there. Remember Jennifer Bryan from above? 
      All of the files for her book, <pubtitle>Happy Git With R</pubtitle> can be found on 
      <url href="https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r">her repository</url>. Soon, you too will 
      have repositories! (Note: a repository is often just shortened to <term>repo</term>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few other tabs at the top of the page. The <q>Repositories</q> tab simply lists all of 
      your repos. (You can also find this page from the drop-down menu by your profile image in the top 
      right.) The other three are not important for basic use (even I haven't used them yet).
