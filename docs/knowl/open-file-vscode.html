<p>Try to open the README file with the terminal. (Remember how? See <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "S_commands" missing or not unique]</code> if not.) What happened?</p>
<p>Any number of things could have happened. It might have worked and VS Code opened with your file ready to edit. Maybe it didn't work at all and no applications opened. Maybe your terminal opened up a different app. The problem with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">open</code> command is that it picks the default application and opens that. For me, by default, all <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.md</code> files open in RStudio. So, I have to specifically tell my terminal that I want VS Code to open the file, not anything else.</p>
<p>Luckily, VS Code has its own command! Remember how every Git command starts with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git</code>? Well that same idea holds for many different commands. To open a file in VS Code, type <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">code &lt;file-name-and-extension&gt;</code> where <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">code</code> stands for VS Code. Now things should work correctly and VS Code should open your file.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_gitedits.html#open-file-vscode" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
