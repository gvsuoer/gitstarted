<p>Github organizes your edits and changes in a tree-like format. The official, published version of your files always lies on the <dfn class="terminology">main branch</dfn>. You could think of the main branch as the trunk of a tree. When we created our README file back in <a href="S_hubfirstrepo.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.2: The First Repository and File">SectionÂ 3.2</a>, we started on the main branch, edited a file, and commited right back to the main branch. It was as if we wrote something new in pen on our official letterhead. <em class="emphasis">This type of editing is usually discouraged.</em> We will explore the idea a little later when we cover merge conflicts, it is best practice to create a new branch, made some edits there, then submit a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch.</p>
