<p>Note that the message is surrounded by quotation marks. This is required so that Git doesn't think that each word in your message is a separate command. They can be either single or double quotes as long as the two match. Also take a look at the output. This tells you the name of your branch, a unique identifier for your commit (so yours will be different than mine), your commit message, how many files were changed, and how many lines were inserted or deleted. This can be useful to verify that the commit worked as you expected.</p>
