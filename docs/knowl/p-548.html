<p>Any number of things could have happened. It might have worked and VS Code opened with your file ready to edit. Maybe it didn't work at all and no applications opened. Maybe your terminal opened up a different app. The problem with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">open</code> command is that it picks the default application and opens that. For me, by default, all <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.md</code> files open in RStudio. So, I have to specifically tell my terminal that I want VS Code to open the file, not anything else.</p>
