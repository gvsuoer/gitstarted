<p>It is worth mentioning a few notes about commits since they can be forgotten or confused.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>A commit is similar to saving a Word document, closing Word, and shutting down your computer. Sure, you can go back and reverse your changes or keep editing, but it would take some time to start your computer back up and open the file. Same with commits. It is possible to reverse a commit, but it can be annoying to have to do so. Git gives you multiple stages in the finalizing process to help you catch any edits you forgot to make.</p></li>
<li><p>If for whatever reason you find that you made a commit too early or did so accidentally, you can reset your current branch back to what it was before the commit, according to Git's knowledge. Details can be found in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/reverse-git-commit.html" title="Git Procedure 13: Reversing git commit">Git Procedure 13</a> in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "S_gittroubles" missing or not unique]</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible to have multiple commits in one push. See <a href="S_gitfinalize.html#SS_git-push" class="internal" title="Subsection: Step 3: Pushing Files">Subsection </a> for more details.</p></li>
