# Your Ideal Superpower

Here is the file for the culminating experience of Chapter 6 from *Git Started*. Below, type your GitHub username as a level two heading and then type a short paragraph of the superpower you wish you had and why. This could be anything!! See my example.

## `ian-curtis`

I think my preferred superpower would be shapeshifting. Ever since I read about the Animagi in the *Harry Potter* books, I have wanted to be able to turn myself into anything. Need to eavesdrop? Be a fly. Need to shut down a party? Be a snake. Ever wanted to fly? Be a bird. So many cool possibilities.

Of course, I would add on the power that I couldn't die while in another form (so no one can use a fly swatter to smash me). I guess that would be too powerful so I guess I'd also have to add that a time limit for how long I could be in another form.
