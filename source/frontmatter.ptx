      Thank you to the Grand Valley State University (<init>GVSU</init>) Libraries, specifically the Scholarly Communications section, for their support while writing this book. This book would not have been written had it not been for Matt Ruen of <init>GVSU</init> who provided useful feedback on accessibility, general <init>OER</init> guidance, organization, and who arranged for a university grant to hire me as a student employee to assist with <init>OER</init> creation and mangement at <init>GVSU</init>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also indebted to Alicia Huber and Jackie Rander for their feedback on the clarity, concision, and effectiveness of the book. The book has benefitted because of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kudos also go to David Farmer, Rob Beezer, Oscar Levin, and the many others who work to maintain and update <pretext/> and its functions. <pretext/> is a great, free resource for authors.
