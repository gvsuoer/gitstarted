  <title>Collaboration Editing With Git</title>

  <idx><h>git</h><h>edit</h></idx>
  <p>
    As before, the title is a little misleading. Git does offer editing features, but, once again, it does keep track of your edits and commits for version control.

    This section will be very short. All you need to do is open <c>secret.txt</c> and type one line of whatever you want (G-rated of course). Literally could be anything. Just something random. Maybe the following will inspire you:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <q>Tick tock</q> went the tick tock croc.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Have you ever tried ham and peanut butter?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The jalepeno, who was too hot, walked into the ocean to cool off and was eaten by a shark who was the first creature to breath fire underwater.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          I recently tripped up the stairs.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Whatever you choose, try to stick to one line. When you are done, save the file (which will tell Git that there are active changes) and move on. The next steps are similar, but not exactly the same as those in <xref ref="S_gitfinalize"/>.
