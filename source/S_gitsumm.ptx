  <title>Summary</title>
  
  
  <p>
    While the project in <xref ref="S_gitbigact"/> is a test of your abilities, it is not a <q>traditional</q> test. I don't expect you to have memorized all of the content of the previous chapter. That will come with time. The process of cloning a repository and editing, staging, committing, and pushing files is something you will repeat over and over again as you work through projects. For right now, please go back to the previous sections if you forget how to do something! For your convenience, a summary of the Git process is provided here. Utilize this summary for the project and for your future endeavors. There is no shame in looking something up to make sure you're doing it right, espeically with Git.

    <p>
      What follows is an ordered list of the steps in the Git process when working alone.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Create a repository on GitHub. (You can also do this with Git, see <url href="https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/init.html" visual="kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/init.html">Karl Broman's guide</url>. I prefer starting with GitHub, however.) See <xref ref="hub-createrepo"/>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Clone the repo to your local computer with <c>git clone</c>. See <xref ref="SS_cloning"/> and <xref ref="try-git-clone"/>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Create an appropriately-named branch with <c>git branch</c> and <c>git switch</c> or with <c>git switch -c</c>. See <xref ref="SS_gitbranches"/> and <xref ref="gitproc-branches"/>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Edit/create/delete files as you please. See <xref ref="S_gitedits"/>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Follow the three step process as described in <xref ref="S_gitfinalize"/>. Don't forget about the usefulness of <c>git status</c> throughout (<xref ref="SS_git-status"/>)!
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Stage your files with <c>git add</c>. See <xref ref="SS_git-add"/> and <xref ref="try-git-add"/>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Commit your files with <c>git commit -m</c>. See <xref ref="SS_git-commit"/> and <xref ref="try-git-commit"/>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Push your files back to GitHub (on your current branch) with <c>git push origin</c>. See <xref ref="SS_git-push"/> and <xref ref="try-git-push"/>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Create a pull request on GitHub and merge your changes into <c>main</c>. See <xref ref="act-git-pr"/>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Go back to your local repo, switch to <c>main</c> with <c>git switch main</c> and pull in your changes with <c>git pull</c>. See <xref ref="try-git-pull"/>.
