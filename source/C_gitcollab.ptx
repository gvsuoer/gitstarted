  <title>Git Collaboration</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      This chapter is closely related to <xref ref="C_gitsolo"/> and <xref ref="C_githubcollab"/> in that the concepts there carry over and are combined together here. The workflow and steps described in this chapter are most similar to the typical day-to-day work from many people around the world when it comes to Git and GitHub.
