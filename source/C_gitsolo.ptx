  <title>Git</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Git is difficult to wrap your head around partly because it's new and partly because it's scary.
      There are many things that could go wrong and that are difficult (but usually not impossible) to 
      revert. But Git's power of version control is so important. The goal of this chapter is to help 
      you get familiar with working with Git on the command line and how it interacts with GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      I assume you have read <xref ref="C_commandline"/> and <xref ref="C_githubsolo"/> before tackling this chapter. The vocabulary 
      used by GitHub is identical to Git's (this is on purpose) and if you understand the basics of how
      Github operates, you will find some of Git to be simple. Git runs on the command line so it is also 
      important to have some experience with a terminal and how it operates.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also assume you have followed along with the GitHub activities throughout <xref ref="C_githubsolo"/>. 
      They are super important for understanding the content and I continue where I left off in this chapter.
      We will be updating the <c>aboutme</c> repository with Git rather than just GitHub.
