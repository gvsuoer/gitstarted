    <p>
      If you have a computer, you have a terminal. You may not have ever used it or known it was there,
      but it's hiding, waiting for use. Let's find it.

      <p>
        Luckily, the terminal is easy to find on a Mac: it's called <c>terminal.app</c> and can be 
        found in numerous ways.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              (Recommended) Press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> to open Spotlight Search.
              Start typing <q>terminal</q> and the app should pop up quickly. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> 
              or click on the result.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Navigate to the Applications folder in the Finder. Then, open the Utilities folder and 
              double click on <c>terminal.app</c>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Find it through the Launchpad. What's the Launchpad, you ask? On most Mac keyboards, it 
              is on the key corresponding to <kbd>F4</kbd> and looks like a bunch of boxes arranged in 
              rows. You can also access the Launchpad by clicking the Launchpad icon in the Dock (also 
              boxes arranged in rows) or by going into the Applications folder in the Finder and double 
              clicking on the <c>Launchpad.app</c> icon. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Once in the Launchpad, find the Terminal. You can either search for it in the search bar 
              at the tope of the screen or scroll through your apps until you find it. (Note: it might 
              be in the Other folder).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Once you open the terminal, you should be presented with a blank screen, such as the one shown 
        in <xref ref="mac-term-start"/>

        <title>Note</title>
        <p>
          At the top of my (Mac) terminal, it says <q>&lt;my-username><mdash/> -bash</q>. This indicates that
          I am using the <c>bash</c> shell. This is no longer the default for MacOS Catalina and later 
          (as the terminal states). 
          I will be sticking with <c>bash</c> in this book to avoid differences between Windows and Mac 
          instructions. 
          If yours states something else (such as <c>zsh</c> or <c>fish</c>) and you would like to 
          use <c>bash</c> to follow along, paste <c>chsh -s /bin/bash</c>
          <fn>This command stands for <q>CHange the SHell to the shell called bash in the bin folder</q></fn> 
          into the command line, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, 
          enter your password to your computer, and restart the terminal. Otherwise, you are free to 
          stick with the default shell; just know that there may be slight differences between this 
          book and your terminal.

    <title>On Windows</title>

    <p>
      For Windows users, the situation is a slightly more complicated. The underlying makeup of the 
      operating systems on Windows is differet than the basis for MacOS and other Unix-like systems 
      (such as Linux). This means that certain applications for Windows do not have a MacOS 
      compliment (and likewise some Mac applications do not have Windows versions). In addition, the 
      file system and organization are different bewteen the two, as we shall see later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Separate instructions must be given for Windows users for certain tasks. 
      To make life easier for you, me, and everyone else, I recommend <em>not</em> using the default 
      Windows terminal. 
      <aside>
        <p>
          The default terminal for Windows is usually the Command Prompt. To access it, activate the 
          search feature of your computer by clicking the search box at the bottom of 
          your screen or by typing <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>. Then search for <q>command prompt</q>
          and click on the result that comes up.
        </p>
      </aside>
      
      <!-- <figure xml:id="windows-term-start">

      Instead, let's use a new terminal (Git Bash) that works well with Git (and conveniently uses the 
      <c>bash</c> shell which allows me to use the same instructions for Mac as Windows). Detailed 
      download instructions can be found in <xref text="title" ref="materials-windows"></xref>. I will assume 
      that you are using Git Bash for the remainder of the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you open Git Bash for the first time, you should see something like the screen in 
      <xref ref="windows-bash-start"/>.

      This will depend on the version and distribution you have installed. For this reason, I will not be able to provide instructions here. Please use the internet for help. Contributions for your specific distribution are welcome through a pull request or issue on GitHub.
